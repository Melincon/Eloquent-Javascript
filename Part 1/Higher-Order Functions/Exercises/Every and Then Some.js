/*Arrays also come with the standard methods every and some. Both take
a predicate function that, when called with an array element
as argument, returns true or false. Just like && returns a true
value only when the expressions on both sides are true, every
returns true only when the prdeicate returns true
for all elements of the array. similarly, some returns true as
soon as the predicate returns true for any of the elements.
The do not process more elements They do not process more elemtns than necessaru
for example, if some finds that the predicate holds for the first element
of the array, it will not look at the values after that.
    write two funtion, every and some, that behave like these
methods. except that they take the array as their first arguments
rather than being a method.*/
